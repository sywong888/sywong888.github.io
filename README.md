## ***Bio***

Hello all! My name is Sydney, and I am a second-year computer science major at University of California, San Diego.

I am highly interested in pursuing a career in software development. You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BpnG5C7_7QAoL8954PnyX6tcK1RgSCBy/view?usp=sharing).

## ***Interests***

###### ***Reading*** :books:

I love to read in my free time! Some of my favorite books are:
- *[Beartown](https://www.amazon.com/Beartown-Novel-Fredrik-Backman/dp/1501160761)* by Fredrik Backman
- *11/22/63* by Stephen King
- *Jellicoe Road* by Melina Marchetta

***One of my favorite quotes from _Jellicoe Road_***:
> If I want more, I need to go and get it, demand it, take hold of it with all my might, and do the best I can with it.

1. Roger Federer
2. Bjorn Borg
3. Martina Navratilova
