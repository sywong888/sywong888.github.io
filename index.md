Hello all! My name is Sydney, and I am a second-year computer science major at University of California, San Diego.

###### ***Reading*** :books:

I love to read in my free time! Some of my favorite books are:
- *[Beartown](https://www.amazon.com/Beartown-Novel-Fredrik-Backman/dp/1501160761)* by Fredrik Backman
- *[11/22/63](https://www.amazon.com/11-22-63-Stephen-King/dp/1451627297/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA_9r_BRBZEiwAHZ_v16_kMcSUt7tQaYmnQahlg2I8xMWEcwNl9S-Ppyrgg_v13iBX_fuvpxoCDF8QAvD_BwE&hvadid=322265982163&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9031300&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=13112424926595159678&hvtargid=kwd-661209436703&hydadcr=10026_10352737&keywords=stephen+king+11%2F22%2F63+book&qid=1610074219&sr=8-1&tag=googhydr-20)* by Stephen King

**One of my favorite quotes from _Jellicoe Road_**:
> If I want more, I need to go and get it, demand it, take hold of it with all my might, and do the best I can with it.
